# Horiseon Refactor

## Description
This is a landing page for Horiseon SEO. I upgraded it to get all of the links functioning, meet accessibility standards, and clean up the HTML
and CSS with semantic elements and code consolidation. I also added flex-boxes and media queries to add responsiveness and make it more mobile-friendly.
